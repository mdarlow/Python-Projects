# Python-Projects

These are some of the projects I made using Python and Django.

# Projects:

* [Django Checkbook](https://github.com/mdarlow/Python-Projects/tree/master/Django_Checkbook)
* [Django University](https://github.com/mdarlow/Python-Projects/tree/master/DjangoUniversity/Classes)

# Django Checkbook
This project is for keeping track of various bank accounts. The application allows for trackable account creation that obtains the user's first and last name as well as starting balance. The user is able to add transactions, which includes date, type (deposit/withdrawal), amount, description, and the applicable account. 

# Django University
This project mimics a university database with administration capabilities to add courses.
